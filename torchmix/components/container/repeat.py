class Repeat(Sequential):
    """Repeat the given module `depth` times.

    `Repeat` creates multiple copies of the `children` and
    applies them sequentially. Every copy of `children` will
    be re-instantiated based on its configuration. The input
    and output shapes of the `children` must be the same in
    order to be applied in this way.

    Args:
        children (Component): The module to be repeated.
        depth (int): The number of copies of `children` to create.

    Examples:
        Repeat(
            nn.Sequential(
                nn.Linear(100, 200),
                nn.GELU(),
