# Global Configurations

`config` context allows you to set global configurations that can be shared across multiple components.

```python copy
from torchmix import PreNorm, Attention

PreNorm(
    Attention(
        dim=1024,
        num_heads=8,
        head_dim=64,
    )
    dim=1024,
)
```

is equivalent to

```python copy
import torchmix
from torchmix import PreNorm, Attention

with torchmix.config(dim=1024):
    PreNorm(
        Attention(
            num_heads=8,
            head_dim=64,
        )
    )
```

  Excessive use of config may hinder readability and make the code less
  explicit. Use with caution.
