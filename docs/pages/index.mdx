# Welcome to TorchMix!

`torchmix` is a collection of pre-made PyTorch components designed to simplify
model development process, primarily for **transformers**. Our goal is to enable
easy adoption of cutting-edge technologies with minimal code and maximum scalability.

One of the key priorities of **TorchMix** is reproducibility.
All components offered by us, as well as those you create, will have the ability
to self-document and can always be serialized into their [`hydra`](https://hydra.cc) compatible configurations.
See [Component class](/component) section for more details.

We've designed **TorchMix** to be as user-friendly as possible. Each implementation
is kept minimal and easy to understand, using [`einops`](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops) to avoid
confusing tensor manipulation (such as `permute`, `transpose`, and `reshape`) and
[`jaxtyping`](https://github.com/google/jaxtyping) to clearly document the shapes of the input and
output tensors. This means that you can use **TorchMix** with confidence, knowing
that the components you're working with are clean and reliable.
