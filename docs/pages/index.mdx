# Welcome to TorchMix!

**TorchMix** is a collection of pre-built and ready to use PyTorch components that
simplifies the model building process.
We've included a range of operations, from basic ones like
[`Repeat`](/components/Repeat) and [`Add`](/components/Add),
to more complex ones like [`WindowAttention`](/components/WindowAttention)
in the [Swin-Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030).

One of the key priorities of **TorchMix** is reproducibility.
All components offered by us, as well as those you create, will have the ability
to self-document and can always be serialized into their [`hydra`](https://hydra.cc) compatible configurations.
See [Component class](/component) section for more details.

We've designed **TorchMix** to be as user-friendly as possible. Each implementation
is kept minimal and easy to understand, using [`einops`](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops) to avoid
confusing tensor manipulation (such as `permute`, `transpose`, and `reshape`) and
[`jaxtyping`](https://github.com/google/jaxtyping) to clearly document the shapes of the input and
output tensors. This means that you can use **TorchMix** with confidence, knowing
that the components you're working with are clean and reliable.
