# Repeat

Repeat the given module `depth` times.

```python copy
Repeat(
    nn.Sequential(
        nn.Linear(100, 200),
        nn.GELU(),
        nn.Linear(200, 100)
    ),
    depth=12
)
```

`Repeat` creates multiple copies of the `children` and
applies them sequentially. Every copy of `children` will
be re-instantiated based on its configuration. The input
and output shapes of the `children` must be the same in
order to be applied in this way.

## Parameters

- `children`: The module to be repeated.
- `depth`: The number of copies of `children` to create.

## Forward
```rust
() -> Any
```
