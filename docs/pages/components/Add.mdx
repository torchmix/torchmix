# Add

Cumulatively add the forward results of the given modules in parallel.

```python copy
Add(
    nn.Linear(100, 200),
    nn.Linear(100, 200),
    nn.Linear(100, 200)
)
```

`Add` inherits from the `Sequential` class and applies a list of modules
in parallel, adding their forward results cumulatively. The output shapes
of the given modules must be the same or broadcastable in order to be added.

## Parameters

- `*args`: `Component` instances whose forward results will be added cumulatively.

## Forward
```rust
(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor
```
